<h2>The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas</h2>

<img src="Book Images/21.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PYJAMAS takes us on a journey through the eyes of Bruno, a young boy who is very naive to what's happening around him. This is the kind of story that fills you with sadness in 
some parts then makes you laugh out loud in others. The descriptive language used throughout the chapters will have you turning the pages for more with this being a great read for teens learning about 
life during those years.</p>

<p>Bruno is living the perfect life in Berlin until his father is promoted and they are required to move. Their new home is not even remotely similar to Berlin and there isn't anywhere for Bruno to explore 
at this new place with every corner sealed. There isn't anyone to play with there either, not like there was in Berlin where he had his three best friends for life. One day at his new home, Bruno looks 
out of his bedroom window and sees something that shocks him. He decides to walk along the extremely long fence by his house without telling anyone. At the end of the trail and what seemed like forever, 
he makes out what appears to be a blob. That same blob turns into a stick figure and with a closer look, that same stick figure turns into a boy. A boy in striped pyjamas...</p>

<p>The author takes us on an emotional trip through time and into the minds of two boys, showing the details of the Holocaust from a child's perspective. This is a book about perception, the nature of 
good and evil, innocence and friendship. The writing style is clever; simple yet perfectly addressing the issues it deals with and elegant yet haunting in its content. While some grisly sections of the 
plot may invoke negative emotions, overall John Boyne provides us with a vital insight into an important part of history with different perspectives portrayed by the characters in unprecedented times.</p>

<h2>Life of Pi</h2>

<img src="Book Images/22.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>This is an incredibly thrilling & dramatic narrative based on a constant fight between life & death, yet it is brought to us in a voice that is measured, paced and scaled. LIFE OF PI teaches us an 
important lesson - to have faith even in the toughest of times. One chapter after another, a 16-year-old Indian boy called Pi encounters new problems but the way he gathers strength to deal with them is 
impossible to comprehend.</p>

<p>It starts with his childhood and youth where he goes through a significant religious awakening in his formative years. When he is a teenager his family decides to sell the animals from the zoo they ran, 
leave his hometown in India and migrate to Canada on a cargo ship named Tsimtsum. A horrific storm rages during the voyage and the next morning Pi finds himself in the company of a badly injured zebra, a 
vicious hyena, a matronly orangutan and beneath the canvas of the lifeboat is a Bengali Tiger. After some killing and eating takes place as per the food chain, only Pi & Richard remain in the lifeboat at 
this point. It is now a matter of how they survive while adrift in the Pacific Ocean...</p>

<p>Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a transformative story of adversity and triumph. Here we have an astonishing work from the imagination that is able to delight and stun readers in equal measure. A casual 
glance reveals the tedious, drawn-out journey of a boy living with all the odds stacked against him. A more in-depth examination has us questioning the role of faith in providing humanity with moral guidance, 
the survival insincts of animals and whether or not we can overcome our own nature when faced with imminent doom. Given that we are taken on a wild, extraordinary ride from a geographical, spiritual & 
emotional perspective. This book is also quite rare in that it will change your view of the world around us.</p>

<h2>The Help</h2>

<img src="Book Images/23.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>A deeply moving novel filled with poignancy, humour and hope, THE HELP is a timeless and universal story about the lines that we should abide by & the ones that we don't. There is a determination in 
three extraordinary women as they start a movement of their own which forever changes the way women, mothers, daughters, caregivers and friends view one another in a town.</p>

<p>Aibileen is a black maid raising her seventeenth white child. However, something has shifted inside her after the loss of her own son who died while his bosses looked the other way. She is a wise, 
regal woman who is devoted to the little girl she looks after but she knows both their hearts may be broken. Minny is Aibileen's best friend and might just be the sassiest woman in Mississippi. She's short, 
fat & can cook like nobody's business. She can't mind her tongue either and it's lost her yet another job. Finally finding a position working for someone too new to town to know her reputation, we learn 
that her new boss has secrets of her own.</p>

<p>They seem as different from one another as possible but the women will come together with a plan that puts everything at risk. Why? Both of them are suffocating inide the lines that define their town and 
their times. Sometimes rules are made to be broken though...</p>

<p>The plot is intricately woven together with characters that are unforgettable, complex and perfectly imperfect. The book as a whole tackles meaningful issues such as racial injustice, rejection, being on 
the outside of a clique and fear. It also touches on important themes like love, hope, bravery and the innocance of childhood. It's fair to say that the title, The Help, has more than just one meaning.

<h2>Still Life</h2>

<img src="Book Images/24.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Sarah Winman's STILL LIFE is a parade of small stories that interconnect, intimate relationships & deeply complex characters. Their lives begin to unravel, illuminating the disaster and the sheer adversity 
faced in Europe during World War II with a great deal of the story taking place in fascist Italy.</p>

<p>It's 1944 in Tuscany and Allied troops advance with bombs falling around deserted villages. Meanwhile a young English soldier finds himself in the wine cellar of a deserted villa. That's where Ulysses Temper 
has a chance encounter with an art historian who has come to Italy to salvage paintings from the ruins and recall lost memories from her own youth. In each other, Ulysses and Evelyn Skinner find a kindred spirit 
in the destruction of their war-torn surroundings.</p>

<p>They set off on a course of events that shapes Ulysses' life over the next four decades. Ulysses then goes back home to London and reimmerses himself with a motley crew of pub crawlers & eccentrics, but he 
still carrying his time over in Italy with him. When an unexpected inheritance brings him back to the same place where it all began, he knows better than to tempt fate and returns to the Tuscan hills.<p>

<p>With exquisite prose, extraordinary tenderness and light-hearted bursts of humour, Still Life paints us a sweeping portrait of unforgettable individuals who come together to make a family in the most unique 
set of circumstances. That is in what is a richly drawn celebration of beauty and love in all its forms.</p>

<h2>The Fault in Our Stars</h2>

<img src="Book Images/25.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is insightful, bold, irreverent and raw. It's also award-winning author John Green's most ambitious and heartbreaking work to date as it beautifully explores the funny, thrilling, dizzying 
highs then the crushing lows of being alive and falling in love. The story is told with such gumption and tenderness that he nearly adds a new genre to literature: romantic teen angst jumbled with big existential 
questions. Musings about the afterlife and adolescent-crush jitters are shoved into the same story yet somehow it all makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Hazel Grace Lancaster is a 16-year-old who is attending a cancer patient support group. During the meeting she meets Augustus Waters who lost his right leg and is currently in remission. The two of them start talking 
and agree to read each other's favourite novels. After finishing An Imperial Affliction, Augustus is disappointed when he finds out that the novel finishes off without a proper conclusion. That inspires the journey 
for them to seek out the author and find out what happened to the protagonist Anna. The problem is hardship strikes and it makes life even tougher. Will they find out what happened to Anna as they both fight cancer?</p>

<p>It feels as though the stakes have been raised from Green's previous novels with a swing for the fences that tackles serious themes like life, love and death while doing it brilliantly. He takes a fairly sentimental 
premise and delivers and honest, immediate and deeply relatable story. Not only that but it's more than deserving of the status as a future classic.</p>

<h2>Educated</h2>

<img src="Book Images/26.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>The writing itself is masterful and it makes EDUCATED what it is. Each story, every chapter & even the words all feel deliberate. Unlike most memoirs that consist of superfluous descriptions, everything about Educated 
is purposeful and are the building blocks for the whole narrative. The structure of the book also helps with the development of the story. As we move in a linear sequence from childhood to adulthood, each story is built on 
top of context that was established in previous chapters.</p>

<p>Born to survivalists in the isolated mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover prepared for the end of the world by stockpiling canned fruit and sleeping with a "head-for-the-hills" bag. Going to the hospital was forbidden 
so she never went to see a doctor or a nurse. Gashes, concussions and even burns from explosions were all treated at home with herbalism. Her family were so isolated from civilised society that there was no one to ensure 
the children got an education and no one to intervene when one of Tara's older brothers became violent. She set out to educate herself, learning enough mathematics and grammar to be admitted to Brigham Young University. 
That's where she studied history and learnt about important events such as the Holocaust and the civil rights movement. Her quest for knowledge transformed her and took her all over the world. At one stage she couldn't 
help but wonder whether she travelled too far. Whether there was still a way home...</p>

<p>This is a truly epic read. While it is an account of the struggle for self-invention it is also a tale of fierce family loyalty as well as the grief that comes with severing the closest of ties. With astute wording 
that sets great writers apart from the rest, Westover has given us a universal coming-of-age story that delves into what education is and what it offers: The ability to see life with fresh eyes and the willingness to change 
it.</p>

<h2>The Hunger Games</h2>

<img src="Book Images/27.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Seen as a work of the imagination ahead of its time, THE HUNGER GAMES shocked the world when it was first published. The concept, foreign and barbaric, blew us all away yet fascinated us so immensely. From the very first chapter 
we were emotionally invested in the characters and the events that were about to unfold.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of what used to be North America the nation of Pamen has emerged. It consists of a spectacular Capitol which is surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is cruel and unforgiving as it keeps all the 
districts in line by forcing each of them to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death with extravagant build-up on live television. Katniss 
Everdeen, a sixteen-year-old girl from district 12, sees it as a death sentence when she volunteers to take her sister's place in the upcoming Games. However Katniss has stared death right in the face before while survival is 
second-nature to her. Without intending to she becomes a serious threat to the other tributes. If she is to win she will have to make some choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. Can she survive on her 
own in the wild and live to see tomorrow with the odds never in her favour?</p>

<p>Her journey is a lot of things as we see the genuine psychological toll of participating in games of that nature. We are left to reflect on the ethical questions regarding murder and self-defence as well as the impact of the 
games as it affects everyone differently. This book also taps into the transformation of our protagonist into a fully-formed human being from trial by fire. Meanwhile the name Panem, coming from the old Latin expression panem et 
circuses ("bread and circuses") is well-suited for a dystopian future eerily like our own present. The best science fiction does not predict the future, instead it reveals the present and The Hunger Games does just that.</p>

<h2>A Brief History of Time</h2>

<img src="Book Images/28.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME delves into the exotic realms of quarks, black holes, antimatter, the big bang, "arrows of time" and an even higher power. It is widely considered a milestone in scientific writing by one of the greatest minds 
in history. The book poses questions that get us thinking, such as: How did the universe begin and what made its start possible? Then there's others like whether time always flows forward? Is the universe endless or are there boundaries? 
Are there other dimensions in space? What will happen when it all ends? And that's if it ever ends...</p>

<p>It also explores ideas on how time stops near black holes, why objects can't travel faster than the speed of ligh, how black holes aren't really black after all and also the science behind the potential of wormholes and time travel. 
Hawking takes all these different ideas and asks scientifically essential questions about the existence of humanity since the beginning of time. He has a quirky sense of humour and each question generates a childlike sense of curiosity 
towards the vastness of the universe.</p>

<p>Complex topics are broken down and explained with language that we can all understand. Overall this makes for a satisfying read where we can understand each concept without any prior knowledge. With exciting images and a profound 
sense of wonder, Stephen Hawking brings us closer to the ultimate secrets of the creation of everything around us as well as the mechanics behind the universe as a whole.</p>

<h2>The Book Thief</h2>

<img src="Book Images/29.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>A work crafted by Australian writer Markus Zusak, THE BOOK THIEF is already regarded by many as a classic that will stand the test of time. It is a historical fiction novel that begins at the start of World War II in 1938 and follows 
the life of a young girl, Liesel, who becomes orphaned. The story is told by Death, who is our narrator throughout the book. This adds a unique voice that is very human and nuanced, especially compared to the way antagonistic Nazi characters 
are depicted. Death tries to justify his role by collecting the stories of courageous humans such as Liesel.</p>

<p>On her way to Germany her little brother dies which haunts her throughout the journey and soon after she steals her first book, The Gravedigger's Handbook. When she arrives at her new home in Nazi Germany, she is taken in by Hans and Rosa 
Hubermann and suddenly has new foster parents. Hans finds out the Liesel can't read so he teaches her the wonders of words which helps her process her brother's death. Her love of books leads her to steal them from precarious places like the 
mayor's house and Nazi bonfires. Her new parents are too poor to buy her books but despite this they secretly shelter a Jewish man whose father saved Han's life. This makes their circumstances even more volatile...</p>

<p>Zusak cleverly flips the commonly accepted position of history on its head. We were taught that all of Germany was complicit in the atrocities of the war yet in realitythere were many who actively resisted the Nazi regime, living their 
lives as well as they ould in such trying times. In this book we have a marvelous story capable of moving readers of all ages. Through deft use of imagery and language this author created a strongly relatable platform to tuch on complex issues. 
He puts us in the unusual position of sympathising with Germans during the war without excusing any of the atrocious behaviour. We feel joyful and saddened over this piece of literary art.</p>

<h2>The Perks of Being a Wallflower</h2>

<img src="Book Images/30.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is a haunting novel about the conundrum of passivity versus passion where its release marked the stunning debut of a provocative new voice from an author in contemporary fiction. It is the story of what it's 
like experiencing the dizzying highs and the crushing lows growing up in high school. Standing on the fringes of life offers Charlie a unique perspective but one day he might want to see what it looks like in the thick of it.</p>

<p>Charlie is shy, introverted and a little bit odd. He enters high school as a freshman with no friends. He then interestingly befriends a few seniors who he spends more time with. He also writes letters that are more intimate than a diary. 
They are singular, unique, hilarious and devastating. We don't know where he lives or who he is writing to though. It's only a matter of time before his world is shaken up as he finds himself caught between trying to live his life and trying 
to escape from it. This places him in uncharted territory and the world of first dates, mixed tapes, family dramas and new friendships.</p>

<p>Chbosky's approach is typically unflinching, even when the content is upsetting. Underpinning everything is a desire to acknowledge the complexities of other people, a reassurance that nobody does bad stuff because they are innately bad. 
Although the book is very confronting at times, it is ultimately uplifting and light-hearted as we take a close look into this stage of Charlie's life plus the defining experiences that shape it.</p>
