<h2>To Kill A Mockingbird</h2>

<img src="Book Images/11.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD became a bestseller and a critical success as soon as it was published way back in 1960. It has since gone on to win many 
prestigious awards and prizes, later being made into a timeless Academy Award-winning film. Told from a child's perspective, it takes place in the fictional 
town of Maycomb, Alabama. Jean Louise "Scout" Finch is an intelligent though unconventional girl who ages from six to nine years old over the course of 
the novel. She is raised with her brother, Jeremy Atticus ("Jem") by their widowed father, Atticus Finch. He is a prominent lawyer who teaches his children 
to be empathetic and just.</p>

<p>When Tom Robinson, one of the town's black residents, is falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman, Atticus agrees to defend him despite 
threats from the community. At one point he faces a mob intent on lynching his client but refuses to abandon him. Meanwhile the children play out their 
own miniaturised drama of prejudice and superstition as they become interested in Arthur "Boo" Radley, a reclusive neighbour who is also a local legend. They 
have their own ideas about him and cannot resist the allure of trespassing on the Radley property...</p>

<p>Compassionate, dramatic and deeply moving are all words to describe To Kill A Mockingbird as it takes readers to the roots of human behaviour - to 
innocence and experience, kindness and cruelty, love and hatred, humour and pathos. It's the unfogettable story of a childhood in a sleepy Southern town 
and the crisis of conscience that rocked it. Harper Lee always considered her book to be a simple love story. Today that same book by a young Alabama 
woman is regarded as a masterpiece of American literature, claiming universal appeal.</p>

<h2>Lord of the Flies</h2>

<img src="Book Images/12.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Best described as a survival and pyschological thriller, LORD OF THE FLIES is a young adult classic that has fascinated readers for many years since its 
release in 1954. We focus on a group of British schoolboys aged six to twelve with the story revolving around their mission to survive. It is a novel that 
brilliantly showcases how easily one can allow the evil of human nature to take control of their actions.</p>

<p>We are taken back to the dawn of another world war when a plane crashes on an uncharted island, stranding a group of schoolboys. At first, with no adult 
supervision, their freedom is something to be celebrated; the boys can do anything they want this far from civilisation. Absolutely anything. They attempt to 
create their own society but fail in the face of evil and sin. Ralph, one of the older schoolboys, is voted by the group to be chief. He brings order to the 
group in an attempt to be civil and get rescuead sooner rather than later. Chaos begind to resurface when Jack, another older schoolboy, would rather go hunting 
instead. As order collapses, strange howls echo in the night and terror begins its reign, while the hope of adventure seems as far from reality as the hope of 
being rescued. The story progresses further, exploring how quickly the primal instincts of savagery and survival can overcome law and order.</p>

<p>It's been labelled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a tale of morality, a parody and a political treatise with a vision of the apocalypse.</p>

<p>One thing for sure is Lord of the Flies is one of the most memorable novels about "the end of innocence and the darkness of man's heart".</p>

<h2>A Tale of Two Cities</h2>

<img src="Book Images/13.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Set against the violent upheaval of the French Revolution, A TALE OF TWO CITIES is a great historical novel written by Charles Dickens. It is the most famous 
and perhaps even the most popular of his works, compressing an event of immense complexity to the scale of a family history. The cast of characters, including a 
bloodthirsty ogress and an antihero, is as believably flawed as it is in any modern fiction.</p>

<p>After spending eighteen years in the Bastille, a French country physician is released and allowed to emigrate to England, where he is reunited with a daughter 
he has never met. Lucie Manette, typical of the women in a Dickens novel, is a pure-hearted angel who is instantly devoted to him despite never having known him. 
Through various plot twists, Lucie marries Charles Darnay, who turns out to be the expatriate nephew of the Marquis who had Doctor Manette imprisoned. This takes 
place in a backstory with an even more improbable plot twist. Once the Revolution begins, Charles is lured back to Paris to save the life of one of his former 
servants. Naturally, he ends up in prison & awaiting trial. His family which includes Lucie and their daughter plus the rest of the cast who all follow him. They 
soon enter a world of peril as they meet Lady Guillotine...</p>

<p>A Tale of Two Cities masterfully intertwines political and personal events, revealing a lot about the injustice the incited the French Revolution. It also taps 
into the grey areas between the populist ideals and blind vengeance as well as the toll the rebellion took on individuals. No love was sweeter than Lucie and 
Charles', no father and daughter were more deeply attached to one another than the Manettes and no character had a greater purpose or better lines than Sydney 
Carlton. This is one of Dickens' best-loved novels and with good reason too. The plot is suspenseful, the scope is far-reaching while the characters are as rich 
and the imagery is as descriptive as can be.</p>

<h2>1984</h2>

<img src="Book Images/14.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Even though the story of NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR takes place thirty-five years prior, it is timely in every sense of the word. </p>

<p>The setting is London, where there has been no new housing since 1950 and as every citizen knows all too well, war is peace. The story is told from the perspective 
of Winston Smith, a low-level party member who works in the "Ministry of Truth". Winston's world is one in which there is no objective truth, only party aproved "facts". 
In the party's view, every "fact" is malleable with one of several possible truths. Which one is true at any given time depends upon which best suits the purposes of the 
party. A great example of this is the global war that has been running for decades between the three super states that exist in 1984. At any one time Winston's nation is 
at war with one and allied with the other. Winston observes that every few years the allegiances suddenly switch for no apparent reason but the official history is that 
those allegiances had never changed. Winston starts to doubt the war's very existence and since it's never directly observed by the reader, he could be right. He begins 
to suspect that the war might just be another tool used by the party to maintain social unity. United against a common enemy...</p>

<p>The true horror and sheer genius of Orwell's 1984 isn't in the mass technological surveillance. Instead it is seen as a cautionary tale that shows glimpses of a disfigured, 
tortured, grotesque society that exists in our near future and is a clear descendent of our own. It is one in which technology is exploited to the point of being detrimental 
rather than beneficial to humanity. It serves as a story about totalitarianism and the disturbingly simple yet powerful ways to gradually and increasingly enslave an entire 
population, which is why it remains relevant today.</p>

<h2>The Old Man and the Sea</h2>

<img src="Book Images/15.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is a classic novel written in 1951 by Ernest Hemingway. It is considered to be the last major work written by the eminent author to be published 
while he was still alive. The book is a short read with less than 100 pages and the story set in Havana, Cuba. We are told the tale of an old fisherman, a young boy and a 
brave yet beautiful fish.</p>

<p>Santiago is an old fisherman who has gone 84 days without fishing. He has now been termed as "salao" by the locals, which means he is suffering from the worst form of 
bad luck. Once a sturdy and healthy man, he was great at his job and would always catch the best fish. Now he is an old, poor man without much to keep his days and mind 
occupied. Even the boy whom he loves dearly and trained so well is forbidden to work with the old man by his parents because of the unlucky streak. Manolin, the young boy, 
loves Santiago and cares for him deeply. He often brings him food and tea and they talk about everything under the sun, especially the American baseball which is Santiago's 
favourite. Determined to change his luck and bring home a catch big enough to get the town talking, the old man sets out on the sea on the 85th day. He goes out into the 
Gulf Stream and his bait soon gets taken by a big fish which he thinks could be a marlin. However, the fish does not relent so easily. The old man is also determined and 
won't let go so easily. What follows is a fight for dear life with both sides equally brave and determined!</p>

<p>The Old Man and the Sea is a beautiful tale, awash in the seasalt and sweat, bait and beer of the Havana coast. It tells a fundamental human truth: in a volatile world, from 
our first breath to our last wish, through triumphs or pitfalls both trivial and profound, what sustains us ultimately is hope.</p>

<h2>Little Women</h2>

<img src="Book Images/16.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>A story that readers have enjoyed for generations, LITTLE WOMEN has gone on to influence many aspiring and successful writers. It is a story of growing up, moral betterment, 
career and marital aspirations as well as fortitude in the face of disappointment and tragedy. It may not be for everyone since it's more sentimental and a bit juvenile but don't 
let that deter you from experiencing one of the all time greats.</p>

<p>We follow the lives of the four March sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy - and the details of their passage from childhood to womanhood. The eldest Meg, is sixteen and very pretty. 
The second, Jo, is fifteen and a bit of a tomboy who is quick to anger. The third is Beth, who is thirteen and and much quieter. The youngest is Amy who is twelve and also a musician. 
The girls must contend with learning to become good women while learning about who they are as people with the help of their mother and father.</p>

<p>The father, Mr. March, signs up to be a chaplain and is away for a lengthy period of time. He urges the girls to be good so when he returns he will be fonder and prouder of the 
little women than ever. The girls all decide to play a game where they try to improve one thing about themselves. Meg decided to be less vain, Jo more feminine, Beth less shy and 
Amy less selfish. Their mother promises to help them on this journey, giving them all ettiquette guidebooks.</p>

<p>This book brought Alcott lasting fame and fortune without being the girl's book that her publisher requested. Instead it touches on common themes like love and death, the 
conflict between personal ambition and family responsibilities, war and peace with the cultural clash between Europe and America.</p>

<h2>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h2>

<img src="Book Images/17.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE in second in a series of classical fantasy books by C.S. Lewis. It has drawn readers of all ages into a magical land with unforgettable 
characters for over sixty years now. It really is a terrific read for young people of both genders where we can all see parts of ourselves in at least one of the four children.</p>

<p>The author takes us to a place called Narnia... A land beyond the wardrobe door, a secret place frozen in an eternal winter, a magical landscape waiting to be set free. A 
girl called Lucy is the first to find the secret inside the wardrobe in a mysterious old house belonging to the professor. At first her brother's and sister's don't believe her 
when she tell them about her visit to the land of Narnia. But soon after Edmund, then Peter and Susan step through the wardrobe themselves. It is in Narnia that they find an 
entire kingdom buried under the ghastly enchantment of the White Witch. When they meet The Great Lion known as Aslan, the realise they've been called to a great adventure. They 
must show bravery and join the battle to free Narnia from the Witch's evil spell.</p>

<p>Arguably one of the finest stories in English literature from the 20th century, C.S. Lewis cemented himself as a master story teller and perfected a novel that would survive 
the test of time, still entertaining and educating children and adults all around the world to this day. On the whole it's an uplifting story about how it's good to be a good 
person and bad to be a bad person. When the bad rise to power and threaten the world, it's up to the good to rally and fight for what's right. There are, however, other themes 
that can be found hiding in the pages. They are the importance of honesty, keeping promises and treating others with respect but if we take it for what it is - A marvelous, lasting 
adventure for young and young-at-heart alike.</p>

<h2>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</h2>

<img src="Book Images/18.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>Set in the antebellum Deep South, this is a beguiling tale about a pair of runaways and the friendship that develops between them as they journey by raft down the Mississippi 
River. You can probably tell that this book will appeal to readers who enjoy adventure. By reading it, young readers are introduced to one of the finext examples of modern literature, 
making friends for life in the characters that make this book what it is.</p>

<p>THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN opens by filling us in with the events of the novel that preceded it, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Both novels are set in the town of 
St. Petersburg, Missouri, which lies on the Mississippi River. Huckleberry Finn, a poor boy with a drunken bum of a father, and his friend Tom Sawyer, a middle-class boy with an 
imagination too active for his own good, stumble upon a robber's stash of gold. After gaining a serious amount of wealth from the adventure, he is then adopted by the kind but 
stifling Widow Douglas who lives with her sister, the self-righteous Miss Watson. As Huckleberry Finn opens, Huck is not happy with his new life of cleanliness, manners, church 
and school. However, he sticks it out as requested by Tom Sawyer, who tells him he must stay respectable to be a part of his new "crew". All is well and good until Huck's father 
reappears in town & demands Huck's money. He hangs around town for several months, harassing his son, who in the meantime has learnt to read and tolerate the Widow's attempts to 
improve him. Outraged when the Widow tells him to stay away from her house, Pap kidnaps Huck and holds him in a cabin all the way across the river.</p>

<p>This has to be the most amusing books Mark Twain ever got around to writing. There is no limit to his inventive genius with the proof being the range and originality found in 
this book. The reader's interest is so strongly invested in the fortunes of two boys and a runaway negro that we follow their adventures with keen curiosity. Nothing can really 
explain this masterpiece where the most unlikely materials are transformed into a work of literary art.</p>

<h2>Les Misérables</h2>

<img src="Book Images/19.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>When Victor Hugo published LES MISÉRABLES in 1862 it became a massive hit with the public. This story about woe, angst, love, loss & redemption is set in early 1800s France. Against a 
backdrop of revolutionary fervour, it's a lengthy read with plenty of twists, turns, subplots within a plot that subverts religious beliefs, politics and society at the time.</p>

<p>Hugo's tale of injustice, heroism and love looks at the struggles of Jean Valjean, an escaped convict determined to put his criminal past behind him. However, his attempts to become 
a respected member of the community are constantly put under threat. Whether it be his own conscience when another man is arrested in a case of mistaken identity or relentless investigations 
conducted by the dogged Inspector Javert. It's not only for himself that Valjean must stay free as he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine, driven to prostitution by poverty. 
He helps her as much as she can before she tragically dies. Valjean, another protagonist in Cosette and a young man called Marius Pontmercy all find themselves in the thick of the Paris 
Uprising that takes place in 1832. The uprising is driven by passionate citizens that are eager to free themselves from oppression.</p>

<p>Les Misérables is a book about right and wrong, love and hate, war and peace, goodness and evil, the rich and the poor. The characters are very believable with great development 
the further we dive in. They all have their place in the story with each playing their unique part, described sufficiently well so they become relatable to us. This is also true for 
other aspects of Hugo's creation where everything comes together and is there for a reason. Here we have an author who can collect different characters and themes, bringing them together 
in a suprisingly masterful way.</p>

<h2>The Wind in the Willows</h2>

<img src="Book Images/20.jpg" alt="A Front Book Cover" style="float:left;width:200px;height:400px;">

<br>

<p>THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS is supposed to be a children's story but it lives in the heart and minds of readers well into adulthood. While the novel is dearly loved for its characters who 
personify the English values of fortitude and good humour, the true joy is in the English life that is portrayed. It is a Gregorian, upper-middle-class take on a world in which countryside 
is covered by an endless summertime and the days are spent idling by the riverside and watching the days pass by.</p>

<p>We start with a peace-loving little animal named Mole who meets another of the animals living by the river, Ratty, who enjoys nothing more than "messing about in boats." After some nice 
afternoons having picnics and spending time by the river, they visit one of Ratty's friends, Toad who explains his latest obsession of horse and cart. One thing leads to another and Toad is 
arrested and sent to prison for stealing a motorcar that he wanted for himself, much to the sadness of the others. Toad is definitely not built for prison life and one of the guard's daughters 
helps him escape. Toad returns to the river, welcomed back by his friends, but finds out that Toad Hall has been taken over by cruel woodlanders - the stoats and the weasels. However there is 
hope with Badger telling Toad about a secret tunnel that leads into the lair of their enemies. The four friends follow it and it is in Toad Hall where an enormous battle ensues.</p>

<p>With Kenneth Grahame's subtle blend of anthropomorphism and uniquely British humour, this is an everlasting tale about river life and friendship. Despite being surprisingly dark & thrilling 
in parts, especially in the later chapters, it has something that few other novels from that time can claim to have: all-round entertainment for all ages. The story affirms the bond that close 
friends have and the courage to be able to make a difference in the lives of others.</p>
